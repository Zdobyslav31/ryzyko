# Ryzyko
Opowiadacz is a browser game created for my studies on Electronic Information Processing. It is an implementation of a popular board game "Risk". The project was concentrated on developing back-end, so front-end is vestigial.
## Description
Risk is a strategic board game about conquering the world. Each user has his forces and fights other players. My implementation includes two computer players - RandomAI (whose movements are all random) and EasyAI (whose actions are more rational, but still it is an easy algorithm).
## Technical data
Project was created in Python 3 language, using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework.
